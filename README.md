# water_storage
The repository provides the dataset and code used to analysis the direct and indirect water storage of Clear Creek after the 2018 Carr Fire (full manuscript: **link**)

Large parts of the code is replicated from the analysis in _Quantification of the seasonal hillslope water storage that does not drive streamflow_ (Dralle et al, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11627). The original code can be found here: https://github.com/daviddralle/indirect_storage
